"""Regression test: checkpoint validation must not crash on manifest-only stages.

`_validate_artifacts_for_stage` looked up `CANONICAL_STAGE_ARTIFACTS[stage]`
unconditionally. Valid stages, however, come from the pipeline manifest
(`get_pipeline_stages`), which declares stages beyond the 9 canonical ones —
e.g. `character-animation` adds `character_design` / `rig_plan`. Those pass the
`stage in valid_stages` guard, then raised an unhandled `KeyError` on the
canonical lookup, so those stages could never be checkpointed. The lookup is now
defensive (`.get`), treating a missing entry as "no required artifact".
