"""Phase 1 golden scenario test — validates the talking-head pipeline
manifest and skill architecture are in place.

The old test ran the Python orchestrator pipeline end-to-end. That layer
has been removed in favor of instruction-driven architecture: the agent
reads pipeline manifests + stage director skills and drives the pipeline
itself.  These tests verify the infrastructure is correctly wired.
