"""Regression for grok_video quality_score (REVIEW §8 #6).

Every premium video provider sets a quality_score (seedance 0.95, runway /
higgsfield 0.9) so the scorer ranks them above stock/local options. grok_video
— which ships native synchronized audio (lip-sync + dialogue + SFX in a single
pass) — had none, so it was ranked only on supports/stability flags and
under-ranked. This pins the field and confirms it surfaces in get_info().
