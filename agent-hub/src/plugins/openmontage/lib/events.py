"""Backlot event stream — append-only tool-event log per project.

Written by the BaseTool instrumentation layer (tools/base_tool.py) whenever a
tool executes against a project directory; consumed by the Backlot board's
watcher to power live activity and per-scene generating states.

Design rules:
- Observability must never break production: every public function swallows
  its own errors. A failed event write is silently dropped.
- Zero agent burden: project attribution is inferred from the tool's inputs
  (explicit ``project_dir`` or any path argument under ``projects/``).
