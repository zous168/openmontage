# Publish Director - Animation Pipeline

## When To Use

Package the animation so the metadata, thumbnail concept, and platform framing reflect the actual visual system of the project.

## Prerequisites

| Layer | Resource | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|
| Schema | `schemas/artifacts/publish_log.schema.json` | Artifact validation |
| Prior artifacts | `state.artifacts["compose"]["render_report"]`, `state.artifacts["proposal"]["proposal_packet"]`, `state.artifacts["research"]["research_brief"]`, `state.artifacts["script"]["script"]` | Final outputs and topic framing |
| Playbook | Active style playbook | Visual naming consistency |

## Process

### 1. Match Packaging To The Animation Mode

Examples:

- diagram-heavy videos should look structured and legible,
- kinetic-type pieces should package around strong copy,
- illustrative animation should package around hero imagery.

### 2. Preserve Visual-System Truth

Store in `publish_log.metadata`:

- `animation_mode`
- `hero_frame_notes`
- `thumbnail_concept`
- `platform_notes`

When the project cover source is **文生图（text_to_image）**, `export_bundle` auto-generates
`exports/thumbnails/thumbnail.png` via `image_selector` using a prompt assembled from
cover hook text, style notes, title, playbook, and deliverable aspect ratio. On provider
failure it falls back to auto frame capture.

### 3. Quality Gate

- metadata fits the actual animation mode,
- thumbnail concept matches the final visual system,
- exports are labeled by purpose and platform,
- the package is usable without extra manual work.

## Common Pitfalls

- Writing generic metadata that ignores the animation style.
- Creating a thumbnail concept unrelated to the final frames.
- Mixing platform variants without clear labels.

## Gate Reminder (Binding)

This stage gates on human approval (`human_approval_default: true`). After review passes:
checkpoint with `status="awaiting_human"`, present the summary (the Backlot board renders
the artifact), and **END YOUR TURN**. Do not start the next stage in the same response.
Approval is per-gate — an earlier "go ahead" does not cover this gate.
