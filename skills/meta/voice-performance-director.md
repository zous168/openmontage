# Voice Performance Director

Use this meta skill whenever a pipeline will generate narration with TTS.

The goal is to make generated narration sound directed, not merely read. Do not
leave expressiveness as "read naturally" in a prompt. Carry a concrete voice
performance plan from script to asset generation, then verify it with a sample.

## Required Contract

Every narration-led script should include a top-level `voice_performance`
object and section-level `delivery_cues` where the schema allows it.

Top-level voice performance:

```json
{
  "performance_intent": "Warm, decisive product narrator with human pauses.",
  "pacing_profile": "conversational",
  "energy_curve": "measured hook, warmer middle, more deliberate close",
  "pause_policy": "Use short pauses after setup lines and longer pauses before reversals or important claims.",
  "provider_notes": {
    "openai": "Use instructions for emotional arc and emphasis.",
    "google_tts": "Use SSML input with break tags when the selected voice supports it.",
    "elevenlabs": "Use lower stability and moderate style for expressive narration."
  }
}
```

Section-level delivery cues:

```json
{
  "pace": "measured",
  "energy": "curious",
  "emphasis_words": ["not", "process"],
  "pause_before_seconds": 0.2,
  "pause_after_seconds": 0.7,
  "delivery_note": "Set up the contrast, then slow down on the final phrase.",
  "provider_text": "This is not just another tool. <break time=\"0.6s\"/> It is a process."
}
```

## Writing Rules

- Write spoken language, not essay language. Prefer short sentences, light
  contractions, and clear punctuation.
- Use silence as structure. Add a pause before reversals, after surprising
  claims, and before the final takeaway.
- Keep pause tags purposeful. Too many breaks sound theatrical and slow.
- Avoid generic directions such as "natural", "engaging", or "expressive"
  unless they are paired with exact pace, emphasis, pause, or energy cues.
- Prefer one delivery idea per section. If a section needs three emotional
  turns, split it.

## Provider Mapping

- OpenAI TTS: use `model: "gpt-4o-mini-tts"` when sending `instructions`.
  Put the emotional arc, pacing, emphasis, and role in `instructions`; keep the
  input text clean but punctuated. Do not send `instructions` to `tts-1` or
  `tts-1-hd`.
- Google TTS: use `input_type: "ssml"` only when adding break tags or other
  SSML. The tool maps this to Google `input.ssml` and wraps the utterance in
  `<speak>...</speak>` when needed. Keep `speaking_rate` in Google's supported
  `0.25..2.0` range and pitch in `-20..20`.
- ElevenLabs: use lower `stability` for more variation, moderate `style` for
  expressiveness, `speed` in the provider's `0.7..1.2` range, and keep
  `similarity_boost` high enough to preserve the voice.
- Offline/basic voices: rely on punctuation, shorter sentences, and explicit
  segment splitting because provider-level emotion controls may be unavailable.
- **Piper**: set `length_scale` in `provider_notes` (typical **0.92–1.05** for
  brisk UGC; never below **0.85**). Values below 1.0 speed speech up; the asset
  stage MUST NOT use a faster `length_scale` than the script specifies.

## Listenability Floor (HARD RULE)

Narration must stay within **normal listenable speech rate**. When audio is
longer than the visual timeline, fix the timeline or trim copy — never compress
speech beyond these bounds without explicit user approval logged as
`category: downgrade_approval`, `subject: "Narration speech rate"`.

| Control | Allowed range (no extra approval) | If exceeded |
|---------|-----------------------------------|-------------|
| Piper `length_scale` | **0.85 – 1.25** (prefer script `provider_notes`) | CRITICAL reviewer finding |
| Post-TTS `atempo` | **0.92 – 1.05** | CRITICAL — forbidden for timeline fit |
| Script vs asset | Asset MUST NOT be faster than script `provider_notes` | CRITICAL |

**Wrong:** TTS runs 14s, video target 11s → set `length_scale=0.66` + atempo fit.  
**Right:** extend `edit_decisions` cuts to 14s, or shorten script, or ask user to accept faster speech.

`lib.production_audit.check_project_voice_listenability()` flags violations in
`asset_manifest.generation_summary` (e.g. `length_scale=0.66`, `atempo fit`).

## Sample Gate

Before batch narration generation:

1. Generate a sample from the most performance-sensitive section, not
   automatically the first section.
2. Verify voice, pace, pauses, emphasis, and emotional arc.
3. If the sample is flat, adjust the `voice_performance` plan or provider
   settings before generating the rest.
4. Record the approved sample path and provider settings in the asset manifest.

## Failure Conditions

Treat these as quality failures:

- A narration-led script has no `voice_performance` plan.
- Section directions only say "read naturally" or "expressive" with no concrete
  pause, emphasis, pace, or energy cue.
- TTS provider, voice, speed, or model changes after sample approval without a
  new sample.
- Final narration is generated from raw script text while structured
  `provider_text` or `delivery_cues` were present.
