/**
 * Build script for @hyperframes/gcp-cloud-run (public OSS package).
 *
 * Bundles each subpath barrel via esbuild → dist/, then emits .d.ts via tsc.
 *
 * Subpaths (each gets its own dist entry so adopters that import one path
 * don't load the others' transitive graphs at module-load time):
 *
 *   .         (the umbrella barrel: server + sdk types re-exported)
 *   ./server  (the Cloud Run runtime entry — what the Dockerfile runs)
 *   ./sdk     (client-side helpers — GCS + Workflows clients only, no
 *             chromium/puppeteer)
 *   ./terraform (stable resolver for the packaged Terraform module)
 *
 * All production deps are kept external so consumers (and the container
 * image) resolve them via their own node_modules.
