/**
 * Cloud Run Chrome resolver.
 *
 * `renderChunk()` (the only primitive that needs a browser) launches Chrome
 * via the engine's `BrowserManager`. Because Cloud Run runs a container
 * image rather than a size-capped ZIP, the Chrome story is far simpler than
 * the Lambda adapter's: the `Dockerfile` installs `chrome-headless-shell`
 * into the image at a known path and exports `HYPERFRAMES_CHROME_PATH`.
 * The Dockerfile proves that exact executable's full BeginFrame screenshot
 * contract during the image build. There is no runtime decompression-into-
 * /tmp step and no 250 MB packaging ceiling to fight.
 *
 * Resolution order:
 *   1. `PRODUCER_HEADLESS_SHELL_PATH` — the engine's own override. If a
 *      caller (or the Docker image) already set it, honour it untouched.
 *   2. `HYPERFRAMES_CHROME_PATH` — set by the Dockerfile to the installed
 *      `chrome-headless-shell` binary.
 *   3. A small list of conventional install paths, as a last resort for
 *      images built outside our Dockerfile.
 *
 * Throws {@link ChromeBinaryUnavailableError} when nothing resolves, so a
 * misconfigured image fails loudly at the first chunk rather than emitting
 * a confusing puppeteer-core "executablePath must be specified" assertion.
