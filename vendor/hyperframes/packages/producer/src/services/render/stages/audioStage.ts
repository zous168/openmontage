/**
 * audioStage — mix the composition's audio tracks into `workDir/audio.aac`.
 *
 * Trivial wrapper around `processCompositionAudio`. The stage is skipped
 * (no ffmpeg invocation) when the composition has no audio elements; the
 * timer is still set so the perf summary stays consistent across renders.
 *
 * Hard constraints preserved verbatim:
 *   - `audioOutputPath` is always `join(workDir, "audio.aac")`, regardless
 *     of whether any audio was actually produced.
 *   - `hasAudio` reflects `audioResult.success` from
 *     `processCompositionAudio`; it is `false` when there are no audio
 *     elements (skips the call entirely) and also when the call returns
 *     `success: false`.
 *   - `perfStages.audioProcessMs` is set whether or not the call ran.
