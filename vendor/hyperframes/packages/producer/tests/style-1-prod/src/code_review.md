# HyperFrame Schema Compliance Review

## Executive Summary

- Total files reviewed: 3
- Critical issues: 0
- Overall compliance status: PASS

## Critical Issues

None. The compositions follow the deterministic requirements and essential timeline registration rules.

## Compliance Checklist

- [x] All compositions have `data-width` and `data-height` attributes
- [x] All timelines are finite with duration > 0
- [x] All compositions registered in `window.__timelines`
- [x] No use of `Math.random()`, `Date.now()`, or non-deterministic code
- [x] Primitive clips have required data attributes (`id`, `data-start`, `data-track`)
- [x] `data-duration` specified for all `<img>` clips (N/A - no images used)
- [x] No manual media playback control (`video.play()`, `audio.pause()`, etc.)
- [x] No manual clip mounting/unmounting in scripts
- [x] Relative timing references are valid (N/A - absolute timing used)
- [x] Clips on same track don't overlap in time
- [x] Reusable compositions in separate HTML files
- [x] Composition files use `<template>` tags
- [x] External compositions loaded via `data-composition-src`
- [x] All script-animated content wrapped in compositions
- [x] No infinite or zero-duration timelines

## File Reviews

### index.html

**Status**: COMPLIANT

**Observations**:

- Correctly defines the root composition `main-video`.
- Uses `data-width="1920"` and `data-height="1080"` as requested for Landscape orientation.
- Properly registers `window.__timelines["main-video"]`.
- Loads sub-compositions using `data-composition-src`.
- Primitive clips (`video`, `audio`) have required `id`, `data-start`, and `data-track`.
- Track assignments are clean: Track 0 (BG), Track 1 (Video), Track 2 (Graphics), Track 3 (Captions), Track 4 (Audio).

### compositions/captions.html

**Status**: COMPLIANT

**Observations**:

- Uses `<template>` tag correctly.
- Root element has `data-composition-id`, `data-width`, `data-height`, and `data-duration`.
- Script is deterministic, using a fixed `TRANSCRIPT` array.
- Correctly registers `window.__timelines["captions"]`.
- Note: The `data-composition-id` in the HTML is `captions`, and the script registers `captions`. In `index.html`, the container has `data-composition-id="captions-comp"`. The framework typically matches the registration to the ID of the element being instantiated. Since the template root has `data-composition-id="captions"`, this is the ID that should be registered.

### compositions/graphics.html

**Status**: COMPLIANT

**Observations**:

- Uses `<template>` tag correctly.
- Root element has `data-composition-id`, `data-width`, `data-height`, and `data-duration`.
- Animations are deterministic GSAP tweens.
- Correctly registers `window.__timelines["graphics-comp"]`.
- Layout is well-coordinated with the A-roll positioning defined in the master timeline.

## Recommendations

- **Consistency**: In `index.html`, the captions container uses `data-composition-id="captions-comp"`, but the template inside `captions.html` uses `data-composition-id="captions"`. While the framework handles the swap during instantiation, keeping these IDs identical (e.g., both `captions`) improves maintainability.
- **Deterministic Logic**: The use of `(function() { ... })()` in sub-compositions is a good practice for scoping.
