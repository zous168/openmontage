## Compliance Checklist

- [x] All compositions have `data-width` and `data-height` attributes
- [x] All timelines are finite with duration > 0
- [x] All compositions registered in `window.__timelines`
- [x] No use of `Math.random()`, `Date.now()`, or non-deterministic code
- [x] Primitive clips have required data attributes (`id`, `data-start`, `data-track`)
- [x] `data-duration` specified for all `<img>` clips (N/A - no images used)
- [x] No manual media playback control (`video.play()`, `audio.pause()`, etc.)
- [x] No manual clip mounting/unmounting in scripts
- [x] Relative timing references are valid (N/A - absolute timing used)
- [x] Clips on same track don't overlap in time
- [x] Reusable compositions in separate HTML files

- [x] All script-animated content wrapped in compositions
- [x] No infinite or zero-duration timelines

### index.html

**Status**: COMPLIANT

**Issues Found**:

- None. The file correctly orchestrates sub-compositions and a primitive video clip using the required data attributes.

### compositions/background.html

**Status**: COMPLIANT

**Issues Found**:

- None. Uses deterministic loops to simulate breathing/pulsing effects over the 16s duration.

### compositions/transitions.html

**Status**: COMPLIANT

**Issues Found**:

- None. Correctly registers its timeline and uses deterministic animations.

### compositions/captions.html

**Status**: COMPLIANT

**Issues Found**:

- None. Dynamically creates content within a composition container and manages it via a GSAP timeline registered in `window.__timelines`.

### compositions/overlays.html

**Status**: COMPLIANT

**Issues Found**:

- None. Uses deterministic staggers and loops for grid animations.
