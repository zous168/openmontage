# HyperFrame Schema Compliance Review

## Executive Summary

- Total files reviewed: 4
- Critical issues: 0
- Overall compliance status: PASS

## Critical Issues

None. The compositions follow the core deterministic and structural requirements of the HyperFrame schema.

## Compliance Checklist

- [x] All compositions have `data-width` and `data-height` attributes
- [x] All timelines are finite with duration > 0
- [x] All compositions registered in `window.__timelines`
- [x] No use of `Math.random()`, `Date.now()`, or non-deterministic code
- [x] Primitive clips have required data attributes (`id`, `data-start`, `data-track`)
- [x] `data-duration` specified for all `<img>` clips (N/A - no images used)
- [x] No manual media playback control (`video.play()`, `audio.pause()`, etc.)
- [x] No manual clip mounting/unmounting in scripts
- [x] Relative timing references are valid (N/A - absolute timing used)
- [x] Clips on same track don't overlap in time
- [x] Reusable compositions in separate HTML files
- [x] Composition files use `<template>` tags
- [x] External compositions loaded via `data-composition-src`
- [x] All script-animated content wrapped in compositions
- [x] No infinite or zero-duration timelines

## File-by-File Analysis

### index.html

**Status**: COMPLIANT

**Observations**:

- Correctly defines the root composition with `data-composition-id="main"`.
- Includes required `data-width`, `data-height`, and `data-duration`.
- Orchestrates sub-compositions using `data-composition-src`.
- Script registers the timeline in `window.__timelines["main"]`.
- Uses deterministic GSAP animations for the A-roll video.

### compositions/intro.html

**Status**: COMPLIANT

**Observations**:

- Uses `<template>` tag as required for external compositions.
- Root element inside template has `data-composition-id`, `data-width`, `data-height`, and `data-duration`.
- Script is wrapped in an IIFE and correctly registers the timeline.
- Animations are fully deterministic.

### compositions/captions.html

**Status**: COMPLIANT

**Observations**:

- Correctly uses `<template>` and required data attributes.
- Manages dynamic text content within a composition, which is the recommended approach for captions.
- Timeline registration is correct.
- **Note**: `data-duration` is set to 20s, while the parent `index.html` limits it to 19.04s. This is acceptable as the parent's `data-duration` or the timeline's bounds will effectively clip it.

### compositions/stats.html

**Status**: COMPLIANT

**Observations**:

- Follows all schema rules for external compositions.
- Uses deterministic animations for complex sport-broadcast style graphics.
- Correctly registers `window.__timelines["stats-graphics"]`.

## Recommendations

- **Relative Timing**: While absolute timing is used correctly, consider using relative timing (e.g., `data-start="intro-comp"`) for better maintainability if the intro duration changes.
- **Consistency**: `captions.html` has a `data-duration="20"`, while other files use `19.04`. Aligning these to the exact master duration is a minor best practice but not a schema violation.
