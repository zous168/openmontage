# HyperFrame Schema Compliance Review

## Executive Summary

- Total files reviewed: 3
- Critical issues: 0
- Overall compliance status: PASS

## Critical Issues

None. The composition follows the HyperFrame schema correctly.

## Compliance Checklist

- [x] All compositions have `data-width` and `data-height` attributes
- [x] All timelines are finite with duration > 0
- [x] All compositions registered in `window.__timelines`
- [x] No use of `Math.random()`, `Date.now()`, or non-deterministic code
- [x] Primitive clips have required data attributes (`id`, `data-start`, `data-track-index`)
- [x] `data-duration` specified for all `<img>` clips (N/A - no images)
- [x] No manual media playback control (`video.play()`, `audio.pause()`, etc.)
- [x] No manual clip mounting/unmounting in scripts
- [x] Relative timing references are valid (N/A - absolute timing used)
- [x] Clips on same track don't overlap in time
- [x] Reusable compositions in separate HTML files (N/A - single composition)
- [x] Composition files use `<template>` tags (N/A - root composition)
- [x] External compositions loaded via `data-composition-src` (N/A)
- [x] All script-animated content wrapped in compositions
- [x] No infinite or zero-duration timelines

### index.html

**Status**: COMPLIANT

**Issues Found**:

- None. The root composition is correctly defined with `data-composition-id`, `data-width`, `data-height`, `data-start`, and `data-track-index`.
- Audio clips are correctly defined with `id`, `data-start`, `data-duration`, and `data-track-index`.
- Tracks are used correctly to avoid overlap for audio clips.

### script.js

**Status**: COMPLIANT

**Issues Found**:

- **Determinism**: The script uses a deterministic approach for particle generation (lines 47, 51) instead of `Math.random()`. This is excellent and follows the "CRITICAL: Deterministic Behavior Required" rule.
- **Timeline Registration**: The timeline is correctly registered in `window.__timelines["magic-cut-intro"]`.
- **Framework Alignment**: The script focuses on visual animations (opacity, scale, particles) and does not attempt to control audio playback or clip lifecycle, which is correct.

### style.css

**Status**: COMPLIANT

**Issues Found**:

- The dimensions match the requested Portrait (9:16) orientation (1080x1920).
- Layout is handled via CSS, which is the correct approach.
