# HyperFrame Schema Compliance Review

## Executive Summary

- Total files reviewed: 4
- Critical issues: 0
- Overall compliance status: PASS

## Critical Issues

None found. The compositions follow the deterministic requirements and structural rules of the HyperFrame schema.

## Compliance Checklist

- [x] All compositions have `data-width` and `data-height` attributes
- [x] All timelines are finite with duration > 0
- [x] All compositions registered in `window.__timelines`
- [x] No use of `Math.random()`, `Date.now()`, or non-deterministic code
- [x] Primitive clips have required data attributes (`id`, `data-start`, `data-track`)
- [x] `data-duration` specified for all `<img>` clips (N/A - no images used)
- [x] No manual media playback control (`video.play()`, `audio.pause()`, etc.)
- [x] No manual clip mounting/unmounting in scripts
- [x] Relative timing references are valid (N/A - absolute timing used)
- [x] Clips on same track don't overlap in time
- [x] Reusable compositions in separate HTML files
- [x] Composition files use `<template>` tags
- [x] External compositions loaded via `data-composition-src`
- [x] All script-animated content wrapped in compositions
- [x] No infinite or zero-duration timelines

## File Analysis

### index.html

**Status**: COMPLIANT

**Observations**:

- Correctly defines the root composition `main-video`.
- Uses `data-composition-src` to load sub-compositions.
- Properly registers the master timeline in `window.__timelines`.
- Uses deterministic GSAP animations for the A-roll video.
- Note: The `grain-overlay` is defined as an inline composition, which is acceptable for simple effects.

### compositions/intro.html

**Status**: COMPLIANT

**Observations**:

- Uses `<template>` tag as required.
- Root element has `data-composition-id`, `data-width`, `data-height`, and `data-duration`.
- Timeline is correctly registered and scoped within an IIFE.
- Animation is deterministic.

### compositions/captions.html

**Status**: COMPLIANT

**Observations**:

- Uses `<template>` tag.
- Correctly handles dynamic caption generation within a composition.
- Timeline registration is correct.
- Deterministic timing based on a static script array.

### compositions/graphics.html

**Status**: COMPLIANT

**Observations**:

- Uses `<template>` tag.
- Root element has all required data attributes.
- GSAP animations are deterministic and use explicit durations.
- Timeline registration is correct.
