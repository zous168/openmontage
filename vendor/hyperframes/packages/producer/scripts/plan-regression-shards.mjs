// Computes the regression workflow's shard matrix instead of hand-maintaining
// it in .github/workflows/regression.yml.
//
// Two problems this fixes:
//
// 1. Staleness. The hand-written matrix was bin-packed once against a specific
//    CI run and then drifted. By the time it was measured again, shard work
//    ranged from 17.2 to 36.8 minutes against a comment claiming "within ~40s
//    of the others" — and CI wall-clock is set by the worst shard.
//
// 2. Silent drift. A fixture only ran if someone remembered to paste its name
//    into the YAML. 25 fixtures that the harness can run were in no shard at
//    all, some for months, and 3 more were rejected at load time for invalid
//    meta.json with nothing louder than a console warning. The default
//    outcome for a new fixture was that it never ran.
//
// Fixtures are now discovered from disk. Every one must be either scheduled
// (with a timing) or explicitly excluded with a reason, or this script fails.
// Drift becomes a build error instead of silent absence.
//
// Usage:
//   node scripts/plan-regression-shards.mjs [--shards N] [--pretty]
