/**
 * Bundle a project to a single HTML string AND localize its fonts — fetch and
 * embed `@font-face` rules for every requested family (including families
 * declared only via a remote `<link>`, e.g. Google Fonts) as data URIs.
 *
 * Why the audit/snapshot paths need this: core's `bundleToSingleHtml` inlines
 * only LOCAL stylesheets and leaves remote font `<link>`s as-is, so a snapshot
 * depends on loading the remote font at capture time. The render pipeline
 * instead localizes fonts in its compile stage, which is why a render embeds
 * (say) League Gothic correctly while a snapshot of the same composition can
 * fall back to an un-styled system sans when the remote font loses the race
 * against the capture. Running the SAME localization the render path uses makes
 * snapshot/check captures font-faithful and deterministic — no network race.
