/**
 * Wires the Design panel's promote-to-variable context. Promote/bind operates
 * on the file the selected element actually lives in — a sub-composition file
 * when you select an element inside an inlined sub-comp, not the host. So we
 * open (and persist to) an SDK session keyed on `selection.sourceFile`, not the
 * host `activeCompPath`. Declaring a variable therefore lands in the sub-comp's
 * own file, making it a knob on that reusable frame everywhere it is used. When
 * nothing is selected (or the element is top-level) the target is the active
 * composition, so behavior there is unchanged.
