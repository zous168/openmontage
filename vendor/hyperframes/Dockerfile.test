# HyperFrames Producer - Regression Test Image
#
# Matches the production rendering environment (same Chromium, fonts, FFmpeg)
# but includes the full source + devDependencies for running the test harness.
#
# This ensures golden baselines match what production actually renders.
#
# Usage:
#   docker build -f Dockerfile.test -t hyperframes-producer:test .
#   docker run --rm -v ./packages/producer/tests:/app/packages/producer/tests hyperframes-producer:test
#   docker run --rm -v ./packages/producer/tests:/app/packages/producer/tests hyperframes-producer:test --update

# Copy source in dependency order, running each build as soon as its own
# inputs are present.
#
# Every package used to be copied here before any build ran, which put the
# `COPY packages/producer/` layer above the core build. Docker invalidates
# every layer below a changed one, so a producer-only change rebuilt core —
# which cannot depend on producer. On CI run 30229469233 those two layers
# cost 86s and 63s of the ~4m image build, in all 8 shards, on every PR.
# Locally the same producer-only rebuild goes from 18s to 1s after this split.
#
# Keep the ordering dependency-correct: anything the core build reads must be
# copied above it, and packages nothing above depends on stay below.

# Skip fixtures tagged `transparency` (Chrome alpha-channel PSNR quirks not
# reproducible on the CI image) and `field-signal-reproducer` (known-broken
# fixture per PR #2512 — codifies a real bug awaiting a fix). Mirrors the
# `--exclude-tags` in the local `test:regression*` scripts in
# packages/producer/package.json so `bun run docker:test*` and the aws-lambda
# smoke tests skip the same set. Docker CMD args from `docker run <image> ...`
# are appended after these flags, so positional test names (e.g. shard args
# `hdr-regression style-5-prod ...` in .github/workflows/regression.yml) still
# resolve normally; the harness applies excludeTags whether testNames is empty
# or non-empty (see discoverTestSuites in src/regression-harness.ts).
